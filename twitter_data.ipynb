The number of social media users in 2020 was estimated to be around 3.6 billion individuals. Social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Youtube) have facilitated interpersonal communication, diffusion of information, the creation of groups and communities, boosting large and small businesses, to name a few. Moreover, online social media users produce an enormous amount of information (high volume), at the fast speed (high velocity), and in different formats, e.g., text, audio, video, graph (wide variety). These three Vs are the principal characteristics of Big Data. Social Media Mining is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful patterns from the Big Data generated from social media platforms.  In this project, we study social media mining from multiple aspects, e.g., trying to make sense of the user-generated content (mostly text), investigating the friendship patterns, applying and revising social theories, etc. <br/> <br/> Relevant papers: <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465336.3475115\"> [1] </a> <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459637.3482418\"> [2] </a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3341161.3342884\"> [3] </a> <a href=\"https://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=23045\"> [4] </a> </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<!--a href=\"project.html\" class=\"button\">Learn more</a-->\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"project\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"project-content\">\\n<!--\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfigure class=\"project-image\"><img src=\"images/project-2.jpg\" alt=\"Project\"></figure-->\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"project-title\"><b>Teachers in Social Media</b></h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p style=\"font-size:18px\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOnline social media has transformed and connected traditional social networks within the schoolhouse to a broader and expanded world outside. Thanks to advancements in communication, educators have access to ample online instructional resources curated and shared across social media platforms. In such an expanded virtual space, teachers engage in various activities within their community, e.g., exchanging instructional resources, seeking new teaching methods, and engaging in online discussions. There are several important reasons why we should care about teachers in social media:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1) Teaching as a career is no longer confined to the physical world, and its development has a huge presence in online social media.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2) Social media is a reliable support group for teachers and aids in the widespread diffusion of educational resources used in various classroom activities. 3) The social media data offers several significant benefits compared to traditional data for studying teachers (i.e., interviews or surveys), e.g., no proxy in tapping into teaching practices and their thinking, real-time access, no response bias, availability of data in a wide variety of formats, etc. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAs a specific application of Social Media Mining, in the Teachers in Social Media project, we devise novel and efficient data mining and machine learning algorithms to understand how and why teachers utilize online social media for pedagogical purposes. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<br/> <br/> Relevant papers:  <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9671476\"> [1] </a> <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/715482\">[2] </a> <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9368377\"> [3] </a> <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3386527.3405941\">[4] </a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-52240-7_24\">[5] </a> </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<!--a href=\"project.html\" class=\"button\">Learn more</a-->\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"project\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"project-content\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<!--figure class=\"project-image\"><img src=\"images/project-1.jpg\" alt=\"Project\"></figure-->\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"project-title\"><b>Learning Analytics</b></h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics\">Learning analytics </a> is the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs.

Online social media platforms (notably Facebook and Twitter) are the major sources of disseminating misinformation.   Misinformation on social media spreads quickly compared to traditional media because of the lack of regulation and examination required before posting. Meanwhile, social media users are highly connected and information can propagate quickly and easily reach a massive amount of users. (Online) misinformation has been identified as a global threat and has major short-term and long-term social, political, economic, and even health-related consequences. Addressing the information credibility problem becomes increasingly important and necessary to provide healthy, trustworthy and reliable online worlds. In this project, we examine misinformation from macro and micro perspectives and develop efficient algorithms and systems to detect and intervene misinformation.\\t    </br> <br/> Relevant papers: <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/C18-1131.pdf\">[1] </a> <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/N19-1347.pdf\"> [2]</a> <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8508296\"> [3]</a>  <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8508654\"> [4] </a> <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8621909\"> [5] </a> </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"project\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"project-content\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<!--figure class=\"project-image\"><img src=\"images/project-4.jpg\" alt=\"Project\"></figure-->\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"project-title\"><b>Fairness in Machine Learning and AI</b></h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><p style=\"font-size:18px\">The elimination of discrimination is an important issue that our modern-day society is facing.

              "<p style=\"font-size:18px\">  Online social media has become an integral part of human life in the 21st century. The number of social media users in 2020 was estimated to be around 3.6 billion individuals. Social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Youtube) have facilitated interpersonal communication, diffusion of information, the creation of groups and communities, boosting large and small businesses, to name a few. Moreover, online social media users produce an enormous amount of information (high volume), at the fast speed (high velocity), and in different formats, e.g., text, audio, video, graph (wide variety). These three Vs are the principal characteristics of Big Data. Social Media Mining is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful patterns from the Big Data generated from social media platforms.  In this project, we study social media mining from multiple aspects, e.g., trying to make sense of the user-generated content (mostly text), investigating the friendship patterns, applying and revising social theories, etc. <br/> <br/> Relevant papers: <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465336.3475115\"> [1] </a> <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459637.3482418\"> [2] </a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3341161.3342884\"> [3] </a> <a href=\"https://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=23045\"> [4] </a> </p>\n",

Thanks to advancements in communication, educators have access to ample online instructional resources curated and shared across social media platforms. In such an expanded virtual space, teachers engage in various activities within their community, e.g., exchanging instructional resources, seeking new teaching methods, and engaging in online discussions. There are several important reasons why we should care about teachers in social media:\n",
              "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1) Teaching as a career is no longer confined to the physical world, and its development has a huge presence in online social media.\n",
              "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2) Social media is a reliable support group for teachers and aids in the widespread diffusion of educational resources used in various classroom activities. 3) The social media data offers several significant benefits compared to traditional data for studying teachers (i.e., interviews or surveys), e.g., no proxy in tapping into teaching practices and their thinking, real-time access, no response bias, availability of data in a wide variety of formats, etc. \n",

Online social media platforms (notably Facebook and Twitter) are the major sources of disseminating misinformation.   Misinformation on social media spreads quickly compared to traditional media because of the lack of regulation and examination required before posting. Meanwhile, social media users are highly connected and information can propagate quickly and easily reach a massive amount of users. (Online) misinformation has been identified as a global threat and has major short-term and long-term social, political, economic, and even health-related consequences. Addressing the information credibility problem becomes increasingly important and necessary to provide healthy, trustworthy and reliable online worlds. In this project, we examine misinformation from macro and micro perspectives and develop efficient algorithms and systems to detect and intervene misinformation.\t    </p></div></div></div></div></div></main></div></body></html> <br/> Relevant papers: <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/C18-1131.pdf\">[1] </a> <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/N19-1347.pdf\"> [2]</a> <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8508296\"> [3]</a> <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8508654\"> [4] </a> <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8621909\"> [5] </a> \n",

Misinformation on social media spreads quickly compared to traditional media because of the lack of regulation and examination required before posting. Meanwhile, social media users are highly connected and information can propagate quickly and easily reach a massive amount of users. (Online) misinformation has been identified as a global threat and has major short-term and long-term social, political, economic, and even health-related consequences. Addressing the information credibility problem becomes increasingly important and necessary to provide healthy, trustworthy and reliable online worlds. In this project, we examine misinformation from macro and micro perspectives and develop efficient algorithms and systems to detect and intervene misinformation.\\t    ') \n",

Learning from human behaviors, AI systems have been shown to inherit the prejudices from humans. Since such AI systems have been integrated in many human-related applications, it is important to ensure that they do not make biased decisions against a particular group of people or individuals. In this research direction, we work on detecting bias in machine learning model as well as developing fair algorithms. Our approaches are applicable to various domains, such as natural language processing, recommender systems and education.   Relevant papers: [1] \\n\\n') \n",
